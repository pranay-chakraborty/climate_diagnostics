Changelog
===============

All notable changes to the Climate Diagnostics Toolkit will be documented here.

**Version 1.3.0** (2025-08-07)
===============================

**Major Architectural Improvements**

- **Complete Code Architecture Refactoring** - Eliminated monolithic `_select_data` method and replaced with centralized `select_process_data` utility
- **Enhanced Exception Handling** - Replaced broad exception catches with specific exception types (ValueError, TypeError, AttributeError) for better debugging
- **Critical Bug Fixes** - Fixed double curly brace f-string formatting bug in TimeSeries module  
- **Performance Optimization** - Streamlined data selection pipeline with reduced redundancy and improved maintainability
- **Import Optimization** - Cleaned up redundant local imports and implemented top-level import strategy

**Enhanced Robustness**

- **Production-Ready Quality** - All modules now follow consistent error handling patterns
- **Improved Maintainability** - Centralized utility functions reduce code duplication and technical debt
- **Better Error Messages** - Specific exception types provide clearer debugging information
- **Consistent API** - All accessor methods now use the same data selection and processing pipeline

**Developer Experience**

- **Cleaner Codebase** - Eliminated technical debt and improved code organization
- **Better Code Documentation** - Consistent patterns make the codebase more readable
- **Enhanced Debugging** - Specific exception handling makes issue identification faster
- **Reduced Complexity** - Simplified method signatures and data flow

Release Schedule
========================

We follow semantic versioning (SemVer) and aim for:

- **Major releases**: Annually (breaking changes)
- **Minor releases**: Quarterly (new features)
- **Patch releases**: As needed (bug fixes)

Version Numbering
========================

Our version numbers follow the format: ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: New functionality (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)

Migration Guides
========================

**Upgrading from v1.0.x to v1.1.x**

No breaking changes! All v1.0 code should work without modification.

**New Features Available:**

.. code-block:: python

   # New in v1.1: Enhanced plotting options
   fig = ds.climate_plots.plot_mean(
       variable="temperature",
       projection="Robinson",  # New projections
       significance_test=True,  # New feature
       colorbar_extend="both"   # Enhanced styling
   )

**Deprecated Features**

- ``old_plot_function()`` â†’ Use ``plot_mean()`` instead
- ``legacy_trend_calc()`` â†’ Use ``calculate_spatial_trends()`` instead
